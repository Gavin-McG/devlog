Weekly Meeting #8
{: .task time="2h"}
With most of the main tasks that we wanted complete, we mostly just used the meeting as a work session, briefly
discussing what could be done with the time we had left. This mostly included certain visual effect and
enhancements, subtle changes to art that we'd received feedback on, and some basic audio implementation.



Clouds
{: .task time="4h"}
One task I'd wanted to work on for several weeks now, but could never find the time, it clouds. The initial idea
that I worked off of is that I wanted to create procedurally generated clouds that appear when zoomed out
enough. I began much like I did when conceptualizing the water shader, where I drafted the shader look in
Blender. Unfortunetly, while blender's code for the voronoi texture was simple enough to port over to HLSL
shader code, Blender's implementation of perlin noise was much nuanced and inconvenient to port over, so the
Blender idea was scrapped for this.

Fortunetly, Unity does provide documentation of their shader graph nodes, which includes their source node. I
used code provided in their documentation and adpated it into my own Cloud shader. While Unity's implementation
of perlin noise doesn't have as much detail, I could make it look more like clouds by combining 2 perlin noise
leyers. To apply this cloud shader I approached it in much the same way as I had the water shader. I created a
large plane, moved it in front of the tilegrid rather than behind, and applied a material with the cloud shader
to it.

As it turns out, having the clouds applied as a mesh in the scene didn't work on account the the transparency of
the clouds. It didn't work at all with the sprite ordering of the tiles in the tilemap, and as far as I could
tell, there was no way to explictly change the rendering order of the cloud's plane mesh.

My next approach was to apply the clouds as a post-process. While I prehaps should have known to go with this
approach from the start, I was lazy wanted to avoid doing the extra math involving camera size and camera
position for the uv coordinates. I created a script which would both apply the post process to the render output
of the camera and send the camera's information to the shader.

<div class="code" href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/F24/post-5/Scripts/Clouds.cs"></div>
This solution both fixed the sprite ordering issues and had a result I was very satisfied with.

R&D Meeting 12/4/24
{: .task time="1.5h"}
With the semester nearing a close we had a lot to talk about regarding the final deliverables of our project.
The R&D groups had 5 main deliverables to prepare: Game Design Document, Programming Design Document, Art Design
Document, Audio Design Document, and the pitch deck. We created pages in the notion which for which the design
documents were to be completed in. The pitch deck, which isn't due until the 15th, took second priority for now.

We also talked about what final changes and additions we wanted to make before the end of the semester. Seeing
as we needed to have an audio design document, and out project presently had zero audio, I decided I would make
it one of my priorities to add a basic system for sound effects.

Connor would work of fixing up certain bugs and tweaking some game balancing parameters. Nadav would work on
completing the wizard tower, which was the only main building which yet to have art implementation. Nadav also
was close to finishing alternative variants of the tree sprite. The prior version of the tree was too close in
color to the grass which was something we'd received feedback on in playtesting.



Sound Effects
{: .task time="2.5h"}
The only time I'd previously worked with sound effects in Unity was for various game jams I've participated in.
In these Game Jams the result is very much thrown together, so while having 12 different Audio sources for each
different sound effect was certaintly a quick solution for a game jam, I figured I should pursue a more clean
solution for this project.

After some research I found that the AudioSource component has a playOneShot() function which can be used to
play different sound effects whenever you want, even if they overlap with one another. I created a AudioManager
script which would hold all the different audio clips and they them in response to certain game events. Manay of
the events for these effects already were added, but others I had to create new events for.

<div class="code" href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/F24/post-5/Scripts/AudioManager.cs"></div>

As for what audio effects I used for this, I added a combinations of effects that I produced quickly using the
online <a href="https://sfxr.me/">JSFXR</a> tool and a couple sound effects I collected from free use sites like
<a href="https://freesound.org/">FreeSound</a>. None of the sounds used from these sources are ideal for a final
product, but for a prototype it's nice to have sound in the game prior to the showcase. There also isn't any
music presently, which is another aspect that would be necessary for the final product.

Design Documents
{: .task time="3h"}
In our previous meeting we decided who'd be working on which of the 4 design documents we were to create. Nadav,
being the artist, would of course be working on the Art Design Document. Connor and I would both contribute to
the programming design document and the game design document, with my primary focus being programming and his
being design. That left the Audio deisgn document. Given none of us had hardly any experience with audio or
music, I decided to volunteer to complete it.

For the programming design document one thing we were supposed to provide was an outline of the programming
structure. I used Canva to produce a basic flowchart which included all of the most major components of the
game's function that I could recall and the major relationships between said scripts.

I also provided a 2-3 sentence description of each of the mentioned components and their functions, going into
more detail about the Buidling, Structure, and Tile information. The last peice of information I chose to
include was information about the coordiante system. I had already created programming documentation for the
coordinate systems, so I made a 2-3 paragraph summary ofthat page.

Again, the audio aspect of game development was something I had very sparse experience with, which is why it was
fortunate that there were references to audio design documents from other projects provided. Using these
ducuments as a rough guide I put all the information I could think to provide.

I chose to describe what vibe/theme the music should have given the genre, lore, and setting of the game. I
found a compilation of fantasy music that I thought might be a good reference, as a playlist was recommended for
this document. I also describes where and what sort of sound effects might be added into the game, including
different sounds for interacting wth different buidlings, sound effects for UI interaction, ambient noises to
make the world feel more alive, and sound effects for dungeon battles.

There was also a brief section to describe the implementation of audio effects, briefly describing the current
system, and that elaborating on this system and implementation of audio would primarily fall onto the
programmer's responsibility.

Weekly Meeting #9
{: .task time="2.5h"}
This meeting was on the final day prior to the showcase. Much like the previous meeting we worked on some final
touches and last-minute art implementation. I spent some time updating the public web build, fixing whatever
compilation error arose during this process. We also discussed with Connor Chen regarding the deliverable drafts
that we'd created and what could/should be changed or improved before the final due date on Dec 15th.
